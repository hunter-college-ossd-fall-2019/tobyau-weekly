## Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert  
Although this was a respectably long article, it provided great insight to balancing "Makers" and "Takers" to scale and sustain Open Source. Some key definitions before diving into the nitty gritty of this article are that `Makers are those who help make Open Source projects; from investing in code, to helping with marketing, growing the community of contributors...` and `Takers are those who monetize Open Source projects without contributing back to those projects`.

**Three patterns for long-term sustainable Open Source**
1. Common goods fail because of a failure to coordinate collective action. To scale and sustain an Open Source project, Open Source communities need to transition from individual, uncoordinated action to cooperative, coordinated action.
2. Cooperative, coordinated action can be accomplished through **privatization**, **centralization**, or **self-governance**. All three work â€” and can even be mixed.
3. Successful privatization, centralization, and self-governance all require clear rules around membership, appropriation rights, and contribution duties. In turn, this requires monitoring and enforcement, either by an external agent (centralization + privatization), a private agent (self-governance), or members of the group itself (self-governance).
