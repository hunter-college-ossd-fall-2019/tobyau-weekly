## Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert  
Although this was a respectably long article, it provided great insight to balancing "Makers" and "Takers" to scale and sustain Open Source. Some key definitions before diving into the nitty gritty of this article are that: <br>
> Makers are those who help make Open Source projects; from investing in code, to helping with marketing, growing the community of contributors...

> Takers are those who monetize Open Source projects without contributing back to those projects




**Three patterns for long-term sustainable Open Source**
1. Common goods fail because of a failure to coordinate collective action. To scale and sustain an Open Source project, Open Source communities need to transition from individual, uncoordinated action to cooperative, coordinated action.
2. Cooperative, coordinated action can be accomplished through **privatization**, **centralization**, or **self-governance**. All three work â€” and can even be mixed.
3. Successful privatization, centralization, and self-governance all require clear rules around membership, appropriation rights, and contribution duties. In turn, this requires monitoring and enforcement, either by an external agent (centralization + privatization), a private agent (self-governance), or members of the group itself (self-governance).

**Self Governance**
Self-governance is very common in small open source communities as it is easy for members to communicate, learn who they can trust, agree on how to collaborate, and so on. However, it gets a little more complex with larger companies as agreeing on proposals might have a negative impact in revenue because complexity increases and benefits diminish.

**Privatization** 
Makers are rewarded unique benefits not available to Takers. This gives the Makers a commercial advantage over Takers, while creating a positive social benefit for all users of the project. 

**Centralization**
Utilizing the Prisoner's Dilemma theory, a Maker is awarded $25 while a Taker is charged $25. The result is that both companies are incentivized to contribute and the optimal equilibrium (both are Makers) can be achieved. 

I think that these 3 principles/patterns are effective ways to sustain an Open Source project as it incentivizes everyone to become a Maker, maximizing revenue of both companies while sustaining contributions towards the project. Unfortunately, as Open Source projects continue to grow it becomes difficult to scale and balance Makers and Takers. There isn't a static method of balancing these groups, so large Open Source projects have to experiment with the reward system.

## Investigating Wikipedia 
Before skipping ahead to contributing to Wikipedia and "A Primer for Newcomers", it's good to know the core principles of Wikipedia which are the [5 pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars).  

| #        | Principles           | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 1 | Wikipedia is an encyclopedia                                             | Wikipedia is not an advertising platform, dictionary, etc... |
| 2 | Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view                        | Wikipedia strives for articles in an impartial tone; without bias. |
| 3 | Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute      | All editors freely license their work to the public, so no editor owns an article and any contributions can be edited and redistributed. |
| 4 | Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility    | Essentially, act in good faith and assume good faith on the part of others. |
| 5 | Wikipedia has no firm rules                                              | Wikipedia has policies and guidelines that can be evolve over time. |

Wikipedia has a plethora of guidelines, features, and tutorials for contributing to Wikipedia. Just to name a few that I came across...
- [Wikipedia: Talk page guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines)
- Every article on Wikipedia has a talk page where discussion and attempts to reach consensus should take place. 
- Tutorials on how to edit Wikipedia pages using [VisualEditor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_editing_(VE)/1) and [WikiMarkup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing)
- [Article Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_development)

**A Primer for Newcomers**
This pages initiates with a warm welcome to all newcomers and right off the bat encourages everyone to be bold and ask questions as there are volunteers available. Newcomers are encourgaed to ask for input or assistance from others through different mediums such as the [Wikipedia:help desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Help_desk), [Teahouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:TEAHOUSE), or by placing the code on the talk page. It is reassuring that there are multiple ways to ask for help and that Wikipedia is trying to make the platform beginner friendly. 

There are set policies and guidelines that people should know before creating or editing content.  
Policies
- [Behavior policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_policies#Conduct): in short, **be polite**
- [Content policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_policies#Content)
- [Deletion policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_policies#Deletion)
- [Enforcement policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_policies#Enforcement)
- [Legal and copyright policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_policies#Legal)

Guidelines
- [Behavioral guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_behavioral_guidelines): violating these guidelines can result in being blocked from editing
- [Content guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_content_guidelines)
- [Deletion guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_deletion_guidelines)
- [Editing guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_editing_guidelines)
- [Naming conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_naming_conventions)
- [Style guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_style_guidelines)

Playing with [Wikipedia's sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SAND) is a great first step to formatting and editing Wikipedia because a lot of the editing policies don't apply there. 

To be completely honest, the hard part about this investigation was reading the lengthy pages. It seems like all the links and resources are readily available in the text but there is a respectable amount of information to digest.

## Gatsby Progress 
After browsing many issues and ways to contribute, I've decided to create a starter template for the Starter Library as my contribution to Gatsby. I saw this as a great opportunity to use my web development skills to create a meaningful product that many users will either use or look at. I've also been meaning to create a website using Gatsby, so why not kill two birds with one stone? This week I started browsing a few starter templates in the Starter Library as well as trending UI/UX designs. 

| Week          | Task   | 
| ------------- |---------------| 
| 10            | Review trending UI/UX designs| 
| 10            | Browse starter templates for inspiration and make note of which features aren't available | 
| 11            | Compile a list of features to use for the website |  
| 11            | Draw or visualize theme |  
| 12            | Start coding | 
| 13            | Finish coding the website | 
| 13            | Deploy to Netlify | 
| 13            | Write documentation for the theme | 
| 13            | Create the Pull Request and hopefully it gets merged!  |
