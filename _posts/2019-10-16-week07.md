title: Week 7 ~ Open Source Project Evaluation

## Gatsby JS Evaluation

For this week, the class formed teams based on open source projects that students were interested in. 
The project my team and I chose was [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Gatsby is an open source framework based on React
that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. The in-class assignment was pretty lengthy, so we 
split and assigned tasks. I was in charge of the code base questions. I focused on the primary language the 
framework uses, how many lines of code are there in total, when the project first started, and so on. 
The assignment was not hard, all thanks to an online app that counts the lines of code in a project and the GitHub API 
to find when the repository was created. This activity opened my perspective of researching an open source project. 
I learned that Gatsby has a comprehensive contributor guide as well as issues for first time contributors. After evaluating this project,
my interest persists.

## My week 
This week, I made a few contributions to OpenStreetMap and will continue to look for open source projects 
to contribute to for HacktoberFest. I also evaluated node from nodejs as my potential project that I'll contribute to.
