## The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric Steven Raymond 
The comparison between the Cathedral and the Bazaar in relation to project development is an interesting take on private and open project development. To clarify what the Cathedral and the Bazaar represents he gave illustrative examples. 
Cathedral - private project 
> I believed that the most important software (operating systems and really large tools like the Emacs programming editor) needed to be built like cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation, with no beta to be released before its time.
Bazaar - open source project 
> No quiet, reverent cathedral-building here—rather, the Linux community seemed to resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches (aptly symbolized by the Linux archive sites, who'd take submissions from anyone) out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles.

3 interesting concepts

3. To be open minded and try new experiences. New experiences might lead to successful results.

## Project Progress - Gatsby 
I decided to contribute to Gatsby because it is good exposure to a framework that I planned on using anyway. Gatsby has a lot of beginner friendly issues that I thought would be a great starting point as my first contribution. Categories for good first time contributions ranges from documentation, bugs, and feature enhancement. For my first contribution, I would like to focus on documentation and then move up to writing code as I familiarize myself with the project. There's a few issues labeled documentation that requests clarification on either how to modify a starter template or how to use Gatsby Themes. Those are the issues that I want to work on as I learn how to use Gatsby. I will continue to search for more document based issues, but as of now I've found a handful of issues I want to work on.

## My week 
My team and I worked on an in class activity to practice git fetch, git merge, and git rebase to synchronize the branches. I have also made contributions to classmate's blogs and OpenStreetMap contributions.
