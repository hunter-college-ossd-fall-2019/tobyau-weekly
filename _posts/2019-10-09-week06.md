## Karen Sandler, Executive Director of the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC)
On October 3rd, our professor had [Karen Sandler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Sandler) visit our class to discuss software licenses and freedom. Here are some of her many professinoal titles:
- Executive Director of the Software Freedom Conservancy
- Former Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation
- Attorney
- Former General Counsel of the Software Freedom Law Center.

Karen is known to be extremely credible in the open source field due to all her experience, but what took me by surprise was her reason and motivation for pursuing this career. She has encountered multiple instances of a doctor being unaware of a medical device's source code and cannot guarantee the security and safety of the device. Ultimately, this drove her to take initiative in trying to open more opportunities for open source software. It was really encouraging and motivational to hear her talk about her health condition in a light-hearted tone.

## The search for a project...
I wasn't sure which projects I wanted to work on so I decided to choose projects that I use or plan on using some time 
in the near future. It might be beneficial to learn about a frameworks source code before or while I'm using it? I also rejected projects like pdf.js and dragula because I didn't feel like adding it to the list, but there's always a chance I might change my mind. 
1. [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
- The most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
- I use this framework a lot because it saves a lot of time on styling web components 
2. [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)
- A framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps
- I'm interested to see how Gatsby works and how it compares to React 
3. [Next.JS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)
- The React Framework 
- provides server-rendering, automatic code splitting for faster page loads, simple client-side routing, etc....
4. [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet)
- JS library for mobile-friendly interactive maps 
- I wanted to learn how to implement maps :)
